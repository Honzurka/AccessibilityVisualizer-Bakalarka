%problem
People often use public transport to travel to places they visit on regular basis. For these people, it would be very useful if they could live in a~place, from which they could get faster to all the places they visit. The problem is how to find such a~place.
%our solution
This problem is what we are trying to solve in our web application. By generalizing the standard public transport search we make it possible to calculate the travel times from user-defined places to all other reachable places. We visualize calculated travel times in an interactive map to simplify the search for the suitable place with the lowest travel times.
%usefulnes
Our web application uses our internal library which contains the functionality required for travel time calculations. This library could be used independently on the web application to solve other problems that require evaluation of travel times by public transport.
